# Big_Data_Hbase

## Enron Emails Archieve on Hbase Database

Plans:
1. Create an hbase database model.
2. Import all emails in hbase.
 Submission Guidelines:
Please follow carefully the instructions posted on the course’s github page when submitting your solutions (https://github.com/MSIA/bigdatacourse/blob/master/README.md). Failure to follow the instructions will result in lost points.
Deliverables:
1. Your hbase and hive source code file: name the file lastname_x.(hbs,sql) (For hbase make sure that the script also includes lines for database model creation.)
2. Output files: name them lastname_x.txt. Here ‘x’ is the number of the task.
3. Return the bodies of all emails for a user of your choice (as a single text file).
4. Return the bodies of all emails written during a particular month of your choice (as a single text
file).
5. Return the bodies of all emails of a given user during a particular month both of your choice (as
a single text file).
